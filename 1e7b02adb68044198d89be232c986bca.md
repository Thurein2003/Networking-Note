Passive information Scanning

**We should use**
**Google docking** first for passive scanning in target
When we search with a google docking method we can find a target information faster than normal way.
***
**WHOIS**
when we scan the target information we should use **whois** search engine method, we can use that in tarminal in linux and other OS. Not only in that we can use **whois** in GUI in web browser.
***
**recon-ng**
In the terminal we can type **recon-ng** to run that tool.
when we use that tool for the first time, we should run **marketplace install all** to install necessary files.
```
[recon-ng] [default] > marketplace install all
```
there have many modules, therefore we need to search the modules what we want. Therefore we need to run this command;
``` recon-ng >> <<default>> >modules search ```

Example;
``` 
[recon-ng] [default] > modules search hackertarget 
```
 when we want to use that command we have to run that, to run that command we have to type this;
 ```
 [recon-ng][default] > modules load recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget
 ```
  To see the infomation of the target 
  ``` [recon-ng][default] > info ```
  example to facebook.com;
  ``` 
  [recon-ng][default][hackertarget] > options set SOURCE facebook.com
  ```
  After that we have to type "run" in terminal, after that we can see the host and IP address of the facebook.com.
