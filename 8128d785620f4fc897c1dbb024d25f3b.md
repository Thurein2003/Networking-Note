Routing between Networks & create a LAN

**Routing Table Entries**
If the router cannot determine where to forward a message, it will drop it.

The process of forwarding the packets toward their destination network is called routing.

***
**Create a Lan**
LAN refers to a local network.

The important thing to remember is that all the local networks within a LAN are under one administrative control. Other common characteristics of LANs are that they typically use Ethernet or wireless protocols, and they support high data rates.

***
Advantages of a single local segment:

Appropriate for simpler networks
Less complexity and lower network cost
Allows devices to be "seen" by other devices
Faster data transfer - more direct communication
Ease of device access
Disadvantages of a single local segment:

All hosts are in one broadcast domain which causes more traffic on the segment and may slow network performance
Harder to implement QoS
Harder to implement security
***
There are many ways to divide networks based on different criteria:

**Broadcast containment** - Routers in the distribution layer can limit broadcasts to the local network where they need to be heard.
**Security requirements** - Routers in the distribution layer can separate and protect certain groups of computers where confidential information resides.
**Physical locations** - Routers in the distribution layer can be used to interconnect local networks at various locations of an organization that are geographically separated.
**Logical grouping** - Routers in the distribution layer can be used to logically group users, such as departments within a company, who have common needs or for access to resources.
