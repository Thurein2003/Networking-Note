**URI, URN, and URL**
Web resources and web services such as RESTful APIs are identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). A URI is a string of characters that identifies a specific network resource. As shown in the figure, a URI has two specializations:

- *Uniform Resource Name (URN)* \- This identifies only the namespace of the resource (web page, document, image, etc.) without reference to the protocol.
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) - This defines the network location of a specific resource on the network. HTTP or HTTPS URLs are typically used with web browsers. Other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, SSH, and others can be used as a URL. A URL using SFTP might look like: sftp://sftp.example.com.

These are the parts of a URI, as shown in the figure:

Protocol/scheme - HTTPS or other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, mailto, and NNTP
Hostname - www.example.com
Path and file name - /author/book.html
Fragment - #page155
